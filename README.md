To run locally clone this repository and open its folder on your terminal. Run the command `yarn` to install all modules (if you prefer using `npm`, delete the yarn.lock file and run `npm install` instead). After that, run the command `yarn start` to start the React server and on another terminal window, run the following command to use our mocked api: `json-server server.json -p 3333`. Done, you can now see all functions and play with it on your browser!
